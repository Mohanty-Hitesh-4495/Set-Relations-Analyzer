# Set Relations Analyzer

## Overview

Welcome to the Set Relations Analyzer GitHub repository! This Java project is designed to analyze the relationships within sets based on mathematical properties, including reflexive, symmetric, transitive, anti-symmetric, and equivalence relations.

## Features

- **Reflexive Relation Analysis:** Determine if a given set exhibits reflexive properties.
- **Symmetric Relation Analysis:** Identify symmetric relations within a set.
- **Transitive Relation Analysis:** Analyze sets to identify transitive relations.
- **Anti-Symmetric Relation Analysis:** Check for anti-symmetric relations in the provided set.
- **Equivalence Relation Analysis:** Identify equivalence relations within a given set.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the Set Relations Analyzer:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SetRelationsAnalyzer.git
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
    cd SetRelationsAnalyzer
3. **Compile and Run:**
   ```bash
    javac MathProjT0.java
    java MathProjT0.java
4. **Input Set:**
- The program will prompt you to input the set for analysis. Enter the set elements separated by commas.
5. **View Results:**
- The program will output the results for reflexive, symmetric, transitive, anti-symmetric, and equivalence relations in the provided set.
## Sample Input and Output
    Input Set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    Results:
    Reflexive: Yes
    Symmetric: No
    Transitive: Yes
    Anti-Symmetric: No
    Equivalence: No
